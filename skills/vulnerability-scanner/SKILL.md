# Vulnerability Scanner

> Scanning tool selection and integration principles.

---

## 1. Scanner Type Selection

### Decision Tree

```
What are you scanning?
│
├── Running application
│   └── DAST (Dynamic)
│
├── Source code
│   └── SAST (Static)
│
├── Dependencies
│   └── SCA (Composition)
│
├── Container images
│   └── Container scanners
│
└── Infrastructure
    └── Network scanners
```

### Comparison

| Type | Scans | Finds | Stage |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| **DAST** | Running app | Runtime issues | Pre-prod |
| **SAST** | Source code | Code patterns | Development |
| **SCA** | Dependencies | Known CVEs | Build |
| **Network** | Infrastructure | Misconfigs | Any time |

---

## 2. Tool Selection Principles

### DAST Tools

| Scenario | Tool Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Web apps | Web vulnerability scanners |
| APIs | API-aware scanners |
| Authenticated | Session-aware scanners |

### SAST Tools

| Scenario | Tool Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Multi-language | Universal scanners |
| Single language | Language-specific |
| Custom rules | Rule-based scanners |

### SCA Tools

| Scenario | Tool Type |
|----------|-----------|
| npm/yarn | Package auditors |
| Containers | Image scanners |
| Full SBOM | Comprehensive SCA |

---

## 3. CI/CD Integration Principles

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Scan Type |
|-------|-----------|
| Commit | SAST (fast) |
| Build | SCA |
| Deploy to staging | DAST |
| Pre-production | Full scan |

### Gate Criteria

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Critical | Block deployment |
| High | Review required |
| Medium | Log and track |
| Low | Informational |

---

## 4. False Positive Management

### Triage Workflow

1. **Auto-filter** known false positives
2. **Context check** - is code reachable?
3. **Manual verify** - is it exploitable?
4. **Document** - mark with reason

### Baseline Approach

- Create baseline of known issues
- Only alert on new findings
- Review baseline periodically

---

## 5. Vulnerability Prioritization

### CVSS + Context

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|--------------|
| CVSS score | Base severity |
| Exploitability | EPSS score |
| Asset criticality | Business impact |
| Exposure | Internet-facing? |

### Priority Formula

```
Priority = CVSS × Exploitability × Asset_Value
```

---

## 6. Reporting Principles

### Report Components

| Component | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| Summary | Counts by severity |
| Findings | Details per vulnerability |
| Trends | Change over time |
| Remediation | Fix recommendations |

### Metrics to Track

- Vulnerabilities by severity
- Mean time to remediate
- False positive rate
- Coverage percentage

---

## 7. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Scan only in CI | Scan in multiple stages |
| Alert on everything | Prioritize by risk |
| Ignore false positives | Maintain baseline |
| Scan without context | Consider asset value |

---

> **Remember:** Scanning finds issues. Prioritization makes them actionable.
